1.  ### Impartiality and Conflicts of Interest 

**Staffers** may not write any content for **WNTT** that could benefit or disparage an organization that the **staffer** is a member of or does work for, even in the Opinion section of the **newspaper**. **Staffers** must also not create content about any subject that they cannot write about objectively. 

 

## Transparency and Accountability

1.  ### Transparency
