        subtitle: ''
        content: >
          While the world is rapidly changing around us, Gen Z is forced to
          grapple with an uncertain future. So we decided to do something about
          it. We Need To Talk is a student-run, activism focused newspaper, that
          provides news for high-schoolers, by high-schoolers. We cover topics
          that are usually ignored by mainstream media, while providing the
          younger generation with a platform to make their voices heard.
