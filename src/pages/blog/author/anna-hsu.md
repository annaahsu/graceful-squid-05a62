      Anna Hsu (she/her) is a 17 year old junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in the United States and the copy editor of We Need To Talk. She first found her passion for journalism through watching ABCâ€™s World News Tonight daily as a young child, fascinated by their reporting, and David Muir still inspires her to this day. Outside of journalism within the realm of written arts, she loves reading romance novels and writing fanfiction. In her (rare) spare time, you can find Anna eating Taiwanese food, watching Studio Ghibli movies and cdramas, and practicing piano for competitions.
