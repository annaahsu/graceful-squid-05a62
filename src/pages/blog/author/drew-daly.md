    content: >
      Drew Daly (he/him) is 17 years old and attends high school in the United
      States. He enjoys music, spending time with friends, and cooking. He is
      also a fiercely competitive member of his schoolâ€™s track and cross country
      teams, and is the vice president of his class student council. The news
      has always been one of the most powerful tools for change, and as someone
      who considers himself a decent writer, Drew is excited to use his skills
      to make a difference.
