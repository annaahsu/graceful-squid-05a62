Women’s role in literature, just like every other professional field in society, has evolved through the ages. Fortunately, today we have come far from the objectification of women as mere ‘sexual objects’ to satisfy gods and men. It is obvious that women’s rights were very limited, or even non-existent in many cases in history. In this time period, women were blamed for wars, destruction of towns and even the death of men.Sadly, these practices still prevail in certain communities.

The Medieval Ages saw a range of reactions to women’s role in literature. In Europe, Nuns wrote books in love of God, the role of women in Christianity ,and following the instructions of the Catholic Church. Literature was primarily composed of religious works along with some secular works. The reason religious work was so prominent (and well preserved) is because clerics ran intellectual life; therefore, it was clerics who produced most of the writing. A good amount of secular works, at least those still preserved, were written by nobles and courtiers who provided accounts of life at court, histories, and even some translations. Notable works include Lais of Marie de France, Memorias by Leonor López de Córdoba and The Alexiad by Anna Comnenann.

In Japan, Feudalism was on rise. Medieval Japanese literature continued the classical tradition of monogatari (court fiction) and waka poetry, which is court poetry from the 6th century to 14th century. Many female writers were noblewomen who were acclaimed poets with their own merits. However, much of their lives went unrecorded, hence the ambiguity surrounding their respective births and deaths. Notable works of Japanese writers include Sacred Rites in Moonlight: Ben No Naishi Nikki, Personal Analogy of Kenreimon-in Ukyō no Daibu: Kenreimon-in Ukyō no Daibu Shū and String of Beads: Complete Poems of Princess Shikishi.

It is no mystery that women did not have equal say in a family dispute, much more the voting rights and wage gap. Women’s literature, although ignored and cursed, has brought about literary wonders and best selling novels, competing with their male counterparts, who were   considered ‘superior’. Infact, “Women’s Literature” was considered a category of writing done by women. Though obviously this is true in a sense, many scholars find such a definition dominating. 

What makes the history of women's writing so interesting is that in many ways it is a new area of study, something which was not given much attention. The tradition of women writing has been much ignored due to the inferior position women have held in male-dominated societies. 
It is still not unheard of to see literature classes or anthologies in which women are greatly outnumbered by male writers or even entirely absent.

Women's literature has categorized and created an area of study for a section of society marginalized by history ,and to explore through their writing their lives as they were while occupying such a unique sociopolitical space within their culture. 

Of course, questions were raised to promote women’s role in literature with development of ideas of Liberty and Equality. Feminead (1754) by John Duncombe ,and Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain Who Have Been Celebrated for their Writing or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences (1752) by George Ballard ,are two important attempts to note women's contributions to literature. They were catalogs published in the 18th century and were written by men. 

Surprisingly or rather unsurprisingly, women’s literature was largely supported by women. The writers who put together a novel with their life experiences and thoughts were read by individuals with similar expected roles in society. The Female Advocate: A Poem Occasioned by Reading Mr Duncombe's Feminead (1774) by Mary Scott is a primary example. The poem was Scott's first publication and is notable because it praises other women writers publishing at the time, including children's writer Sarah Fielding and Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a writer whose political opinions eventually led to her being blacklisted after she published an inflammatory poem on her disagreement with the British Empire’s involvement in the Napoleonic wars.
