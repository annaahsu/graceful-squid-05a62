This year, President Biden signed an executive order repealing the ban of transgender people in the military, and Democrats, who have generally expressed more support for the LGBTQ+ community, control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate.  Regardless, 2021 has seen the highest amounts of anti-transgender legislation filed in US history.

This year, over 30 states have introduced one or more bills that aim to cut back the rights of trangender people, especially trans youth. With over 85 bills introduced, these bills attack the rights of transgender people in many different ways, from allowing healthcare and insurance companies to discriminate against trans patients or forcing state employees, such as teachers, to out trans youth to their parents. However, over half of these bills would prohibit trans kids from participating in school or youth sports.

HB 1570, otherwise known as Arkansas’ Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, passed on April 6th, and will come into effect in July 2021 if it is not contested in court. The law would prohibit Arkansas doctors from treating transgender patients under 18 with any kind of gender-affirming care, which includes HRT, sex reassignment surgery, and puberty blockers. HRT, known as Hormone Replacement therapy, is usually testosterone or estrogen, and they cause permanent changes unlike puberty blockers, which pause puberty for trans teens. The law also prohibits trans youth that are already taking puberty blockers or HRT from being prescribed more. 

Young trans kids need supportive environments: a 2020 survey conducted by the Trevor Project found that out of the trangender and nonbinary kids surveyed that had attempted suicide in the past year, 26% percent did not have access to binders, shapewear, and other gender-affirming clothing, compared to the 14% who did. Even with Arkansas being the first state to introduce a bill like this, the law creates precedent for future scenarios. This law uses trans youth as a political pawn for Republicans to further their anti-lgbtq+ agenda, and puts doctors in a position where they have to decide between providing potentially life-saving treatment or keeping their medical degree.

Another law which similarly and dangerously disregards the wellbeing of trans youth is HB 391, a bill recently signed into law by Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey. The law bans transgender girls from participating on the school sports team that matches their gender. There has been no scientific evidence that trans women have an unfair advantage in sports, nor have there been reports of trans women dominating in sports. Even more, studies have found no consistent link between testosterone and higher athletic performance. All this law does is alienate trans kids from their peers - and trans kids already face higher amounts of bullying in schools.

In the Tennessee house on April 19th HB 1233 (SB 1367) was passed, and it is another example of blatant transphobia. The bill would force transgender students to use the bathroom that does not align with their gender identity, and schools could face legal consequences if a student believes that they shared a locker room or bathroom with a trans student.

All of these bills are simply attempts to validate transphobes and further stigmatise trans identities. Fortunately, there are ways that you can help. The ACLU has a list of legislation that affects lgbtq+ rights across the country and even if you don’t live in a state where one of these bills could become a law, I encourage you to call or email governors or state legislators. Check out the Call to Action section for this link, along with the link to a site that has scripts for contacting legislators, and instructions on how to contact legislators in states where some of the most transphobic bills have been introduced.
